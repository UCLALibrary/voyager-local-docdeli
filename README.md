# voyager-local-docdeli
Scripts to support document delivery requests from Voyager to CDL.  This is highly specific to UCLA & CDL.

Current version is `new_docdeli.pl`.  It can be run alone, but should be run via [wrapper script](https://github.com/UCLALibrary/voyager-scripts/blob/master/vger_docdeli) in a production environment.

Old version of perl and shell wrapper scripts preserved in `obsolete` directory.
